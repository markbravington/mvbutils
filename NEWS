2.12.20: 
 - 'find.scriptlets' added
 - fixed newly-R-introduced bugs (AKA "non-backwards-compatible features" :/) re max() & min() on empty numeric_version objects
 - fixed some (new?) alleged problems from CMD CHECK

2.12.14: 'lazyData' and 'lazyDataCompression' should now work properly.

2.12.2: 'vignette.pkg' now precompiles in a child R process, to avoid eg library path woes.

2.12.0: bit of a tidy-up, importing a few more functions; bumped minor version for sake of dependencies in other packages such as 'gbasics'

2.11.0: now uses 'docattr' or 'string2charvec' and raw strings to hold plain-text documentation and other character-mode attributes. 'flatdoc', 'source.mvb', etc should now be obsolete.

2.9.38: incorporated 'multimatch', 'A2D', and 'D2A' from package 'handy2' (the latter two with slight name and syntax changes). 'A2D' should eventually be made generic--- at present, it's hardwired to do the right thing on 'offarray' objects.

2.9.32: fixed CRAN-check bug in examples of 'mvbutils.utils'

2.9.30: added 'sourceable'

2.9.22: added 'mwhere'

2.9.20: added 'visify'

2.9.0: tidy-up and ready for new 'offarray'

2.8.510:
 - Doco bug fixes; added 'Imports: grDevices' ('graphics' already imported, so no cost).

2.8.509:
 - added utils 'xsub', 'xgsub', 'undent', and 'REPORTO' (the latter mainly for 'offarray'). Decided to use version numbers in here!
 - finally moved 'numvbderiv' and 'numvbderiv_parallel' in here (and changed names) out of 'handy2'. Thus added 2 parallel-related packages to 'Suggests'.
 - added 'mvb_session_env()' and dottonym to ultimately replace the 'mvb.session.info' search-path environment. I'll gradually change stuff in 'mvbutils' to refer to this instead.
 - patches to 'pre.install' to workaround 'Rd2roxygen' not dealing properly with S3
 - probably lots of accumulated minor tweaks--- most recently to 'make_dull' and adding an 'undull', to cope better with implicit classes and the S3wamp.

2.8.387
 - 'mdeparse' for better deparsing of ':=' and '?'; workaround for bug in 'utils::isS3method' that was blowing up 'update_loaded_packages'

2.3.384
 - added health warnings to 'mlazy' doco re 'environment' objects

2.3.383
 - added 'eclone()'; added 'recursive' argument to 'lsize()'.
