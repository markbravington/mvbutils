2.9.22: added 'mwhere'

2.9.20: added 'visify'

2.9.0: tidy-up and ready for new 'offarray'

2.8.510:
 - Doco bug fixes; added 'Imports: grDevices' ('graphics' already imported, so no cost).

2.8.509:
 - added utils 'xsub', 'xgsub', 'undent', and 'REPORTO' (the latter mainly for 'offarray'). Decided to use version numbers in here!
 - finally moved 'numvbderiv' and 'numvbderiv_parallel' in here (and changed names) out of 'handy2'. Thus added 2 parallel-related packages to 'Suggests'.
 - added 'mvb_session_env()' and dottonym to ultimately replace the 'mvb.session.info' search-path environment. I'll gradually change stuff in 'mvbutils' to refer to this instead.
 - patches to 'pre.install' to workaround 'Rd2roxygen' not dealing properly with S3
 - probably lots of accumulated minor tweaks--- most recently to 'make_dull' and adding an 'undull', to cope better with implicit classes and the S3wamp.

2.8.387
 - 'mdeparse' for better deparsing of ':=' and '?'; workaround for bug in 'utils::isS3method' that was blowing up 'update_loaded_packages'

2.3.384
 - added health warnings to 'mlazy' doco re 'environment' objects

2.3.383
 - added 'eclone()'; added 'recursive' argument to 'lsize()'.
